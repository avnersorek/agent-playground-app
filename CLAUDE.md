# Emoji Double

Emoji Double is a simple web-based memory game where players find matching emojis between two grids.

## How It Works

The game displays two 5x5 grids of emojis side by side. One emoji in the left grid has a matching pair in the right grid. The player's goal is to find and click the matching emoji to advance to the next round.

**Gameplay:**
- Each round shows two emoji grids (left and right)
- Find the emoji that appears on both sides
- Click the matching emoji to progress
- Rounds increase with each successful match

## Technical Implementation

For architecture, code structure, and development guidelines, see [docs/implement.md](docs/implement.md).


## General instructions

- Always do ONLY what you are requested to do, never add features, infrastrucutre, options or capabilities without an explicit requirement.
- Remove unused code.
- Do not duplicate code, instead restructure shared code for reuse.
- Always follow patterns that exist in the codebase.
- Check the codebase for existing implementations that might be similar to what you are implementing.
- Check the codebase for existing flows and logic that might contradict or overlap with what your are implementing.
- Write as few comments as possible.
