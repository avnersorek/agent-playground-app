# Emoji Double

Emoji Double is a simple web-based memory game where players find matching emojis between two grids.

## How It Works

The game displays two 5x5 grids of emojis side by side. One emoji in the left grid has a matching pair in the right grid. The player's goal is to find and click the matching emoji to advance to the next round.

**Gameplay:**
- Each round shows two emoji grids (left and right)
- Find the emoji that appears on both sides
- Click the matching emoji to progress
- Rounds increase with each successful match
